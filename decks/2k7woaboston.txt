Deck Name: Darby Dance of the Seven Veils

Description:
An adaptation of various Darby Dance decks, particularly John
Newquist's 12/17/06 Razorbat: Atlanta winner (at least, that was the
one that I saw a bunch of this tech in), modified to adapt to Boston's
heavy-intercept typical metagame - one-stealth actions just rarely cut
it, and 2 stealth sometimes isn't enough - by bolting in some OBF
vampires into the crypt for Cloaks, Veils, and some blood-doll bloat.
Also solves the problems of the classic Imbued vulnerability to
Smiling Jack, Reins of Power, Ancient Influence, etc., at the cost of
a little less reliability in the crypt, which bit me once badly in the
3rd round (all 4 vampires out of 5 crypt cards looked at).While I
can't claim credit for much of the deck-manipulating innovation, Luc
is just plain GOLD - the +3 hand-size action works great as an end-of-
the-turn action to set up your hand for next turn.  I think I'm going
to switch out Jeffrey Mullins for a second Luc.
