-- 4vp in the final

Johannes Commands the Legion

Basic idea was to use Command the Legion in any deck. I
made a G4/5 Ventrue, but was not too happy about it. Consulted the TWDA
and found Otto's G4/5 Ven, from where I borrowed a lot of ideas.

crypt was nice, opted to double Johannes, well because it is
Johannes. Also I have Victor, never drew him, though. most people have
DOM which is good

not too many surprises here. monastery is cool, esp. when followed up
with a parity shift. i have 6 trifles there, master section is light
which is good because the deck cycles really fast

light on action cards since often your actions don't suceed, rather
have modifiers. mind rape are great doubling as defense and forward.
command the legion is really good when you can pull it off, disabling
blockers and deflecters and just freak drive afterwards

just enough payload to get the VPs. didnt have any seductions at
first, but this was very useful, just enough freak drives would have
missed every single one. perfect paragon is pretty good, versatility is
well worth the blood

light vote package to justify the freak drives and much needed
poolgain

just enough to keep people guessing

i was not sure at all about those cards, but both proved to be very
effective. versatility really rules in this deck
