-- 5vp in the final

All of a Sudden

After getting obliterated in the first tournament by
voting decks I broke out one of mine I had been trying on JOL with
on and off success. After a fair showing in R1&2 the deck took
advantage of a great series of turns late in the final. Early on
it got rushed into the ground by Deep Song and spent midgame rescuing
and hunting, while taking a shot at its prey when able. After the ANI
rush had to go upstream the deck got a turn and ousted the next 3 preys
with 3 consecutive KRCs, with the ANI not able to dunk enough vampires
in the all but meaningless last few turns. The deck has trouble with
any real intercept and the Sacrifice was used twice by Kyle Strathcona
to kill a Neighbor John.
