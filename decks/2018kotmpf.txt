Royal with Cheese

1GW5 (3rd seed) + 1.5VP in final


A deck built around the cheese-shaped discipline (Protean) and votes, hence the deck name. The deck relies on very versatile cards and is able to adapt to many situations.
It is a bit slow to build up, but it is not necessarily a bad thing as you don't want to be the bad guy too early. The deck has some hand jam problems, another Heart of Nizchetus could help.
Also, I spent 3 rounds wondering why I wasn't drawing any Pentex Subversion. I really don't know why there is not any in this deck.

Adana is the real star of the deck because she has everything needed. You must be careful with Hardestadt until he gets his Protean skill because he has access to 9 less S:CE.
// Aksinya helps surviving bleed decks and cycles the extra Zillah's Valley or Wider View you may draw. André is very nice when you can't afford another high-cap vampire,
// or if you can afford him in extra, and a 10 hand size (with the Monastery) is awesome.
