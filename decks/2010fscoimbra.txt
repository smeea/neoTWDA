Better Gentlemen, Same Sticks

After the EC in 2009 I thought about the decks that
impressed me the most and Hugh's Gentlemen with Sticks was one of
them. At the time Grinders weren't all that known in Portugal.
Being the fan of Ventrue that I am, I thought the KoT vampires would
bring advantages that the Sabbat vampires don't have, like 2nd
Tradition, inherent votes for defense and other goodies.
Played with deck in tournaments for a year and went to every Final
with it. Except the EC:(
