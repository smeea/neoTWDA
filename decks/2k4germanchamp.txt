For those interested: I didn't PTO a single vampire in any of me 4
games:D

It plays fairly simple. Get out a justicar quickly, parity shift to
recover, bring out Arika or Leandro. Tap him, and start bleeding. In
essention it kills by bleeding, but the votes allow you an enourmous
impact on the table. I never got more then 3 points with this deck, so
in the future I would add more ousting power.
