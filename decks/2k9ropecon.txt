Tutte bjuder till fest

The deck is best slow-played, not to show off too much
dominate to keep the table guessing at whether you play combat or
votes. Using mirror walk and obedience to never get into a combat you
don't want to enter. Just wait the game out and take the last two VPs
before anyone knows what's happening (at least that's the idea ^_^).
Works really well in a combat environment, would probably be weak
against vote decks with stealth - but thankfully I never had to face
that.
