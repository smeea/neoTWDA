A Sudden Anarch Troublemaker

Jeffrey Thompson won using this deck with 4 victory points in every
round, including the finals. Only 1 victory point was acquired via
Dramatic Upheaval, this happened in the first round. This was the
same deck he played at the North American Continental Championship
where he also took 1 game win.

Get the Anarch Troublemaker in play early. Use it on the
turn you expect to finish your prey, or on a turn where it will make a
big enough difference that you can afford to have it used by your
prey. Optimally, you will play another one on the turn you give it to
your prey to prevent them from using it should they survive your
attack. Sudden Reversal is key to preventing other decks from
destroying you or your strategy. Successful Sudden targets included
Minion Taps, Blood Dolls, Fame, and Ventrue Headquarters.
