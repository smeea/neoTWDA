"Never smile at a crocodile"

supposed to refill for Tap/Doll with Heidelberg, though the threat of that existed more than the reality...

I've been playing a lot more 80-card decks than 90 lately; none of
my non-rush-combat decks seem to run out of cards very often at all
even at 80.

Form of Corruption is great, especially if it makes your prey
afraid to bleed too much and keeps him from ousting. It seems to
be often better to hang on to your Form until after your initial
prey is ousted and then steal one of your (former) grandprey's
vamps with it; it's a big boost on your way to (trying to) get
that second oust.

This deck is actually exactly how I designed it on paper before
ever playing it, except that I switched a Hesha Ruhadze for a
second Kephamos after writing it down (but still before playing
it). Funny because my whole goal in the two weeks before the
tournament was to come up with a decent deck and have time to
tweak it before the event, but the one I ended up wanting to
play didn't need any tweaking (at least from the couple games
I'd tried it in beforehand).
