Setites Bleed with Stealth

Notes: Our champion Marcelo <aka jackfruit> is an old player who just got back
in the game and played with a incomplete deck. The player benefited immensely
from the reactions in his deck on this tournament meta. This deck should soon
be upgraded with 1 more form of corruption and at least 3-4 enticements.
