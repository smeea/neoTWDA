Deck Name: [2010 TW] The World's Biggest Small Multirushers
Description:
Many thanks to Fred Scott for lending me 2 Tupdogs for this
tournament.   Generally, I have found a 2.5:1 Tupdog-to-!Tremere ratio
to work out pretty well, though a long string of Dogs at the top pf
one's crypt is frustrating.

The objective for this deck is to get additional mileage from the
Tupdogs...decreasing their effective cost from 1 pool per action to
0.5 pool per action and further leveraging both the rush and the slave
option (rush first, untap, available for slave clause, take an action
of the slave clause is not needed).

The deck is supposed to carry 1 more Ashur Tablet, but I seem to own
only 5 at this time.  4, 6 or 7 seem like the right numbers to me,
depending on your risk tolerance and recycling needs.

Synergies:
Carver's + Dragonbound and Carver's + Vessel are pretty clear.
Carver's + Raw Recruit is an indefinate hold on a Recruit target (that
could not be Graverobbed).  Carver's not affecting Tupdogs is a bonus.

Heidleburg can save master vampires from dangerous hunting
requirements, can empty a Tupdog of before it explodes and allows 2
Hand of Conrad actions per turn.

a "good" combat ran "set close and agg hands, grapple, prevent and
untap"
