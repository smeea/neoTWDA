Mergen's Quandry

[CEL] gun

Built so that I could better understand the way [CEL] gun decks win
tables. Named in honor of my friend Kevin's critique of the 1st cut
deck design at the 2006 NAC.

I pay slightly more than the bare minimum for G1/2 vampires with
[CEL] to support Atonement and a touch of [pre].

One Waste Management Operations could fit in here.

It's rare to feel that I need more rushes to impact both predator and prey.
I think this is the right number, combined with the 3 Frontal Assaults.

Never seen impactful use - this would be my first cull.

The combat package is pretty bulky - but is resilient and pretty effective

I seldom count on equip actions for the .44, so the NRA PAC should be culled.

The 3-card vote package is the most consistent source of pool damage in this deck,
despite my vampires' lack of titles.

These should probably be "Eluding the Arms of Morpheus" for Yawp Court and Atonement.
