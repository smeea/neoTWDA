Broccolini

This deck was developed independently from (but about the same time as) Esa-Matti Smolander's 17 Sept 2019 winner. The designs turned out similar because there's a single logical path for development with these vampires:
1) Get too many MPA and discard options,
2) Play Ashur Tablets,
3) Profit.

I suspect I'm a little more ruthless in discarding than Esa-Matti is - I have one more set of Tablets and want dual stealth locations. Between Blithe Acceptance and those locations, I can leverage a more compact stealth module from that point forward.

Who Eats A Lot Of Broccoli is clearly the focus. If I don't get him early I'm behind the curve, digging for Wider View and pushing subsequent Tend the Flocks + Info Highway for pool gain. The deck would probably run better with 5/13 Huitz since it can limp along without Giotto if needed - but having a valid target for Tend is still pretty important.
The 3 Anarch Converts give the Railroad stealth, but also provide 1-3 chump block options if that's needed more. I seldom get the High Priest unless I'm pretty far ahead in the mid game (like, never???)
