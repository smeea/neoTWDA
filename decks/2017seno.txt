Stick Men BUT with 0 surprises

This deck is the definition of unoriginal but a really good deck if you're
trying to learn a lot about the game with just one build. Ultra resilient and
only a couple of real weaknesses. The ability to consistently get 3-4 DOM
vampires with no real threat to your own pool can't be understated. Launching
3-4 bleeds of 6 a turn tends to be unstoppable as they can only archon one.

None of this is news and I don't think I need to give much analysis on the
ability of this deck as everyone has been ousted by it at some point or another
by now.
