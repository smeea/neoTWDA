You die, we win.

Didn't have too many problems on the day and the combination of bone
crunching combat and 2nd tradition seemed to handle most things. A
little slow getting the first point in the final, which nearly
scuppered my plans.

The first version of this had 4 Don Cruez. I later decided that using
a smaller crypt and another Protean master was probably the way to go.
I may even drop the Dons to 2 and add a second Beast. I usually went
for either Theo or Volker first, on the basis that the Don was just
too big. Although, to be fair, his maneuver did save me a couple of
times against the Wookie's assamites.

Not much in the way of subtlety, but hey, burning vampires is fun.

Remember kids, don't do drugs.
