The Crypt That Should Not Be

1 + 2 + 4VP in final

Little bit of this, little bit of that leveraging a crypt that I've previously suggested might be reasonably strong. A good case could be made for running Gustaphe as the sole lead, but I wanted one minion with both +1 bleed and [OBF].

This version is vulnerable against political decks, but fairly well rounded otherwise. It is entirely coincidence that the number of actions, modifiers, masters and combat cards are pretty much equivalent. These ratios just seemed to flow correctly in casual playtesting.

Another compact module, but deep enough to be effective with 2-4 cap vampires untapped to bounce

A light combat package that remains just effective enough with prevalent Villeins. Easy to dump with Gustaphe.
