-- 3vp in the final

Enkidu PRO CEL

I got some inspiration from Aleksi Nuora's TWD to build this one.
Protean and Celerity are great costless polyvalent combat
disciplines (there are only 3 Claws that cost blood amongst
the 60 combat cards). I playtested and tweaked it lots of
time during our weekly session (thanks to my patient victims)
and I'm quite happy about it.

Enkidu in 5 copies sometimes didn't show up. I added one copy (with a 13-crypt card to draw more side-kicks)

Master come quite quickly because you cycle lots of cards.
--You can even jam with master even there are only 11 of them, but it's quite rare.

Crypt (13 cards, min=7 max=44 avg=6.31)
