This deck won the February monthly tournament in
Gothenburg. The point of the deck is to dish out more damage then you
take, even if you take a lot of damage yourself, which you do.
However, enough Blood Dolls and the Hungry Coyote as well as perhaps a
stolen weapon and these guys are up there with the best.

Basic strategy is to use Enchant Kindred at superior and get the Blood
Dolls out to make your pool grow. Get out at least three vampires and
then you're good to go.

This deck should probably lose two vampires in favour of one more Theo
Bell and his Advanced copy.
