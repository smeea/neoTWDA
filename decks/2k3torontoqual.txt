Description:
Here's the deck. It started out as an exact duplicate of one of "The
Lasombra's" decks called "In the Presence of the Lasombra" but was
quite a bit different after some last-minute tweaks. And it could use
a lot more frankly. I still contend that this deck is not that
fantastic. I welcome any comments, and if people are interested, I
will reveal what changes I think should be made based on all the hand
jam I was getting all day.
