<h1>V:TES Hall of Fame</h1>
<h2>Formerly hosted on the Lasombra</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>To enter the V:TES Hall of Fame, a player has to win a minimum of five tournaments,
and those tournaments must have had their results posted on the official V:EKN Player's Forum:
<a href="http://www.vekn.net/index.php/forum/9-event-reports-and-twd">http://www.vekn.net/index.php/forum/9-event-reports-and-twd</a> for inclusion in the
<a href="http://www.vekn.fr/decks/twd.htm">Tournament Winning Deck Archive</a>.
Many amazing players will be missed because of the absence of those public results.
This list celebrates those who have done well with the game, and have worked to publicize
the strengths of the game by publishing their tournament winning deck lists.
Players are listed by the number of tournaments that they have won, and if there is a tie
for the number of tournament wins, then they are in alphabetical order by their first name. Players receive a star after their name for each national or continental champion title gained.</p>
